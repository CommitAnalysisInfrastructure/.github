# Commit Analysis Infrastructure

The Commit Analysis Infrastructure (ComAnI) is an open and configurable infrastructure for the extraction and analysis of commits from software repositories. 
For both tasks, individual plug-ins realize different extraction and analysis capabilities, which rely on the same data model provided by the infrastructure.

This organization hosts the repositories containing the individual extraction and analysis plug-ins as well as the main infrastructure.
This infrastructure represents the starting point for any person interested in reading more about the general capabilities and using it in a particular setting.
The corresponding repository is therefore pinned below.

All artifacts hosted as part of this organization have been created as part of the research activities carried out by members of the [Software System Engineering](https://sse.uni-hildesheim.de/en/fb4/institutes/ifi/software-systems-engineering-sse/) group of the [University of Hildesheim](https://www.uni-hildesheim.de/en/).
